\begin{abstract}

  As a followup to the Bachelor Project for creating tooling for the Scudo allocator, this
  project focuses on using the tool and the acquired knowledge of Scudo to try to find
  exploits of heap errors, similar to existing exploitation techniques for the standard
  libc allocator.

  Using the fact that the checksum used to secure the header of a chunk is breakable with
  a single header leak, we introduce two exploits that use a free operation where we can
  control preceding bytes to get control over the next chunk allocation locations.

  One of these two exploits has already been fixed in the latest Scudo version, while we
  propose a mitigation for the second one.

\chapter{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Bugs related to heap memory are one of the most frequent problems encountered
by C developers since in bigger projects it can very quickly get hard to track
all the resources that are open and which were already closed. It is very tedious
to track all of such errors down, and just a single oversight might create a bug
that opens a huge security vulnerability. Additionally, nowadays, many apps are so
complex that they use various third-party libraries to do different tasks since
re-implementing everything on your own would be a waste of time. However, one
hardly has the time to check the whole source code of every library one uses, so
one has to trust the library developers to have done their work correctly. An
example of where such trust was the cause of a major vulnerability is a remote
code execution in WhatsApp that was found in 2019, where a simple double free
in a third-party GIF library allowed an attacker to get arbitrary remote code
execution.~\cite{whatsappRCE}

Since checking all the code of all third-party libraries is practically not
feasible, it is important to be able to debug heap bugs when they are found, in
order to understand how they happen, the consequences of an exploit using the
bug might have, and to be able to fix the bug rapidly. To encourage
and assist developers in this process, there needs to be some freely available
tools that make dynamic debugging of the heap easier.

Since Android devices are used daily by millions of users, with many thousands to
millions of different apps, the attack surface for exploits is huge. That might
well be one of the reasons that Android uses the new and mostly unknown heap
allocator called Scudo.~\cite{llvmScudo} Scudo tries to mitigate some of the potential
vulnerabilities due to heap bugs directly in the allocator while keeping a high
performance for memory allocations.

In a previous project, we analyzed the inner workings of the Scudo allocator and developed
a gef plugin to debug programs using the Scudo allocator.~\cite{scudoTooling} Using that
plugin and the general knowledge acquired during that project, we aim to find some
exploits that are possible with the Scudo allocator and figure out how to circumvent some
of the specific mitigations already integrated in the Scudo allocator. If we find some
exploits, we implement a possible mitigation for it and propose it to the official Scudo
developers, as a pull request on the llvm github repository.

\section{Basics}

The Scudo hardened allocator divides the heap allocations it is asked to do into two big
types of allocations, based on the size of the chunk to be allocated.  The smaller chunks
are handled by the primary allocator inside Scudo, which is designed to optimize
performance as much as possible by adapting to finer-grained size differences between
these smaller chunks. All the big chunks are handled by the secondary allocator, which is
less optimized, since the most frequent chunks are the small ones and thus the primary
allocator has a bigger impact on performance than the secondary allocator.

\section{Combined Chunk Header}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l r}
    \toprule
    ClassId & 8 bits \\
    State & 2 bits \\
    OriginOrWasZeroed & 2 bits \\
    SizeOrUnusedBytes & 20 bits \\
    Offset & 16 bits \\
    Checksum & 16 bits \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Layout of the Scudo chunk header}\label{fig:ScudoChunkHeader}
\end{figure}

The chunks allocated by both the primary and the secondary allocator store some metadata
in a combined header. This header is then stored just in front of the actual content of
the chunk, such that it can easily be checked whenever the chunk gets accessed. An
overview of the contents of this header can be seen in \autoref{fig:ScudoChunkHeader}. The
ClassId identifies the class the chunk belongs to in case it was allocated by the primary
allocator, with a ClassId of 0 meaning that the chunk was allocated by the secondary
allocator. The header also contains information about the state of the chunk, which can be
allocated, quarantined or available, as well as the origin of the allocation, e.g., malloc
or new, which can be used to detect errors when the type of deallocation does not match
the type of the allocation. Furthermore, the header includes the size for the primary
chunks or the number of unused bytes for the secondary chunks and an offset, which is the
distance from the beginning of the returned chunk to the beginning of the actual backend
allocation.  Finally, the header contains a checksum, which is generated using a cookie (a
random number generated during the initialization of the allocator), the heap address of
the chunk, and the actual content of the header. This checksum is used for guarding
against programming errors as well as attackers, and it is checked each time the header is
loaded.

\section{Secondary Chunk Header}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l r}
    \toprule
    Prev & 64 bits \\
    Next & 64 bits \\
    CommitBase & 64 bits \\
    CommitSize & 64 bits \\
    MemMap & 128 bits \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Secondary chunk header on linux}\label{fig:ScudoSecondaryChunkHeader}
\end{figure}

The secondary header stores some additional information in a header which is prepended to
the normal chunk header. First it stores pointers to the next and previous large chunk
headers, which forms the doubly linked list of allocated secondary blocks. These pointers
are used in the Safe Unlink Secondary exploit which is explained in a later section. Then
it stores the CommitBase and CommitSize, which are the address of the chunk itself and its
size. Lastly it stores some mapping information which can depend on the underlying
operating system, but in the case of a linux OS it simply corresponds to the MapBase and
CommitBase. These are similar to CommitBase and CommitSize, but they may be slightly
different due to alignment requirements. All these values are, contrary to the combined
chunk header, not protected by a checksum, so they could be changed without trouble if we
have write access to them.

\section{Secondary Cache}

The secondary allocator has its own cache, in which it simply stores the free'd secondary
chunks in a simple list, and before allocating a new chunk it searches the list for a
chunk whose size is at most a certain number of pages larger than the requested size. The
values stored in this cache list, are based on the values of the secondary chunk header at
the moment the chunk is free'd. Interestingly, no integrity checks are done on the values
saved in the cache, which is used in the CommitBase exploit which is explained in a later
section.




Talk about chunk header integrity checks, checksum, class id, cache

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Breaking the Cookie}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To check the integrity of chunk headers, Scudo uses a CRC32 checksum whenever hardware
CRC32 is available, otherwise it instead uses a software BSD checksum. Both of these
checksum algorithms are similar in that they aren't cryptographically secure. The cookie
used to calculate the checksum is 32 bits long and used as the starting value for the
CRC32 (or BSD) checksum.  However the actual checksum stored in a chunk header is only 16
bits long, so in order to shorten the checksum, the XOR of the lower 16 bits with the
higher 16 bits is taken.

Due to the checksum only being 16 bits, instead of the full 32 bits from the cookie, it is
possible to find a cookie collision and produce the same checksums the original cookie
would have produced. Indeed it is enough to get a single heap leak of a complete chunk
header together with its address. To accomplish that we can simply bruteforce the cookie
value until we find the same checksum that we leaked. Using a C program this takes around
1–2 seconds, however due to the poor performance of loops in python, the bruteforce does
not natively work in python. Therefore we created a small python library written in native
C code, which can be used to calculate checksums and bruteforce a cookie given the header
leak data from within python.

The python library exposes four different methods, \emph{bruteforce} to bruteforce the
cookie value from the address, checksum and header data taken from a header leak,
\emph{calc\_checksum} to calculate a checksum from the address and header data as well as
the cookie value, and the same methods followed by \emph{\_bsd} to do the same for the BSD
checksums which are used when no hardware CRC32 is available.

\section{Change Class ID}

\subsection{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Header leak with corresponding address
\item Free where we control the \emph{0x10} bytes in front of the address
\end{itemize}

Result: Move a primary chunk to another size class, making potentially larger chunks in a
small chunk region and multiple chunks overlap.

\subsection{Requirements}

The change class ID exploit needs some flaws in the target binary to be applicable.  First
we need to somehow leak a header value along with its address, in order to bruteforce the
cookie and forge new header checksums like explained earlier. Then the attacker also needs
to have a free operation occurring, at an address in front of which we can write some
bytes, specifically \emph{0x10} bytes in front of the free target. Finally there needs to
be some primary chunk allocations after the free, which are located in the same class ID
as our target we want to move the chunk to.

\subsection{Explanation}

For the retrieval of the cookie refer to the previous section for a thorough explanation
on how it works.

Once the attacker has the cookie, he needs to find a vulnerable free operation, where he
can write data to the \emph{0x10} bytes in front of the free'd address. This can be
achieved in different ways, but the most likely might be an overflow while writing to a
chunk of a small size, causing the attacker to be able to write over the header of one of
the next chunks. Though the exact offset from the first chunk which contains the overflow
and the target header is random due to Scudo's defence mechanisms, the attacker can still
manage to overwrite it with some spraying and random luck if he can execute the program as
often as he wants.

The attacker then calculates a new valid header with its corresponding checksum thanks to
the bruteforced cookie. In this case the attacker probably wants to get a large chunk in
the small chunk region, thus he will replace the header with one specifying a larger class
ID instead of the original one.


When the chunk with the forged header gets free'd, it will be put into the cache of the
larger class ID, and when a chunk from that same class ID gets allocated again, Scudo will
allocate a larger sized chunk in the small chunk region.

\section{Safe Unlink Secondary}


\subsection{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Header leak with corresponding address
\item Scudo library base leak
\item Three consecutive frees on the same address
\item Control over the \emph{0x10} bytes in front of the address before the first two
  free's
\item Control over the \emph{0x40} bytes in front of the address before the third free
\end{itemize}

Result: Next allocation will be a chunk in the perclass structure itself (thread-local
free list), allowing control of future allocations


\subsection{Requirements}

The safe unlink exploit has a certain number of requirements that the target binary needs
to fulfill.

First of all we need a header leak of any chunk from the heap as well as it's address, in
order to bruteforce the cookie. Afterwards we can forge any header checksum from the
cookie we calculated from this leak.

Second we need a free for which we can control a certain number of bytes before the free,
more specifically we need to control \emph{0x40} bytes in front of the address of the
free. This is the size of the secondary header plus the size of the padded primary header.

Third we need two interesting places in memory (at addresses `add1` and `add2`
resepectively) that have the address of the free address from the previous step stored. We
will store \emph{add2} at \emph{add1+0x8} and \emph{add1} at \emph{add2}. Therefore `add1`
and `add2` should be in some interesting location allowing elevation of our access.  The
easiest way to get this is by having two more free's of the chunk in the previous step and
being able to control the \emph{0x10} bytes in front of the address to modify the
header. With this method we however also need a leak of the scudo lib base, in order to
get the location of the thread-local free list (PerClass list).

\subsection{Explanation}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/SafeUnlinkMemory.png}
  \caption{Illustration of different important memory regions}
  \label{fig:SafeUnlinkMemory}
\end{figure}

As with most scudo exploits, the first step is to get the cookie, which can be done from
any single header leak, as explained in the dedicated section.

Then we need to have two locations in memory that point to the chunk we will tamper with
in the next section. The way we achieve this is by having two frees on that same chunk,
leaving it's address twice in the perclass structure next to each other. The perclass
structure constitutes the first level, thread specific free list of chunks. It is handled
as a simple array of chunk addresses, and therefore freeing the same chunk twice leaves
two pointers to that chunk right next to each other in the perclass structure. This setup
is especially interesting since getting the allocation of a chunk in the perclass
structure could allow us to control all following allocations and to allocate chunks at
arbitrary addresses. The only obstacle is that we need to modify the chunk header before
the second free to mark the chunk as allocated again.

Once we have setup the two addresses in the perclass array, we need to know it's address
still. To calculate the address of the perclass array(s) we need to have a leak of some
scudo address, like the base address where scudo is loaded or the address of the malloc
function. We can calculate the offset needed from there based on the scudo version, and
then advance by \emph{0x100} times the value of the class id where we free'd the
chunks. Then we just need to guess the number of chunks present in the perclass structure
of that class id.

Finally we need to prepare the header of the final free that will trigger the safe
unlink. For that we need to configure a fake secondary header in front of the primary
header, as well as modifying the latter to set it's class id to 0. We set the prev
(\emph{chunk\_addr - 0x40}) to the first of our locations \emph{-0x8} and the next
(\emph{chunk\_addr - 0x38}) to the second of our locations. With the perclass setup, we
can set both of them to the address where the first of the two addresses is stored.  Next
follow the CommitBase, CommitSize and MapBase, MapSize. We can set them to the values we
want, we can set them to whatever since we don't actually use them. They have a size of
\emph{0x8} bytes each.  Finally we just need to set the primary header with the class id
set to 0 and the checksum recalculated.

When the free of that chunk then happens, it is handed to the secondary allocator since we
set the class id to 0. The secondary allocator tries to remove the chunk from the linked
list of in use chunks, even when our fake chunk never was in it. So it tries to set the
Next->Prev pointer to Prev and the Prev->Next pointer to Next, which leads it to write the
addresses of our locations in the perclass structure to those same addresses, which will
allow us to allocate a chunk in the perclass structure itself.



\section{Exploit CommitBase}

\subsection{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Header leak with corresponding address
\item At least one secondary chunk allocated
\item Free on any address where we control \emph{0x40} bytes in front
\item Allocation of secondary chunk of known (approximate) size
\end{itemize}

Result: We can choose an arbitrary location for the secondary chunk allocated

\subsection{Requirements}

The forge secondary exploit has a certain number of requirements that the target binary
needs to fulfill.

First of all we need a header leak of any chunk from the heap as well as it's address, in
order to bruteforce the cookie. Afterwards we can forge any header checksum from the
cookie we calculated from this leak.

Second we need a free for which we can control a certain number of bytes before the free,
more specifically we need to control \emph{0x40} bytes in front of the address of the
free. This is the size of the secondary header plus the size of the padded primary header.

Third we need there to be at least one secondary chunk allocated before the free, and we
need there to be another secondary allocation afterwards, of which we know the approximate
size. This is the allocation where we will get our arbitrary access.

\subsection{Explanation}

The breaking of the cookie works exactly the same as explained previously, and the first
part of this exploit also reuses a previously introduced exploit. Indeed the first part is
basically a change class ID exploit, except that we don't change the class ID to a
different primary one, but to the special class ID 0, that is used to designate chunks
from the secondary allocator.

The second part exploits the unsecured secondary header and the secondary cache. When
freeing a secondary chunk, the info from its secondary header is put into the cache, and
when allocating a new secondary chunk the cache is checked for a similarly sized
space. Since we can change the secondary header of our fake secondary chunk, we can change
the CommitBase and MapBase to any address where we want to allocate a chunk, and
CommitSize and MapSize to our desired size. When setting the size we need however to pay
attention to the fact that the cache is only checked for similar sized chunks, so the size
we set can only be a certain number of pages larger than the next allocation where we want
our chunk to be allocated. The exact allowed size difference may depend on the specific
configuration of Scudo.

Following that, the next secondary chunk should be located at our chosen address. The
special requirement that there was at least one secondary chunk allocated previously, is
due to the way the free of a secondary chunk works. Indeed freeing a fake secondary chunk
that was not correctly allocated previously somewhat corrupts the tracking of allocated
secondary chunks. While the list of allocated chunks itself is stored as a linked list
with the chunks itself, and as such the freeing of the fake secondary chunk doesn't touch
that list, it still modifies the number of items recorded for the list. Since this number
is stored as an unsigned int, if there was no previously allocated secondary block, our
free of the fake secondary chunk would cause a negative overflow, and on the next
allocation the program would crash, so before we could get our arbitrary chunk.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Mitigation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Safe Unlink Secondary exploit was already fixed in the latest scudo version, and we
only detected it due to partly working with an older version of scudo. However it worked
in certain configurations up to the version \emph{XXX}.

The CommitBase exploit on the other hand was still applicable to the latest scudo version
as of this project. So after discovering it and having proven it works, we also thought
about a possible mitigation, which was proposed to the official scudo/LLVM team in form of
a pull request on December 13th, 2023.

This proposed mitigation tracks in a separate memory region the addresses of all currently
allocated secondary chunks and only adds free'd secondary chunks to the cache if they were
recorded in this dedicated memory region.

The tracking in this mitigation happens through a simple list of addresses, which is
looped over at allocation/deallocation. Each block of contiguous memory has a at compile
time configurable number of addresses stored, as well as one additional address pointing
to the next block in case there are more addresses.

Two options where added in the Allocator Config to configure the exact functioning of the
mitigation and to completely disable the mitigation if it is deemed too expensive in some
configurations.

  \bottomrule
\end{longtable}

In order to benchmark the changes of the mitigation, we used some custom benchmarks to
test for impact with very targeted programs, results of which are show in
\autoref{tab:CustomBenchmark}, as well as a benchmarking suite for malloc implementations,
mimalloc-bench, which is usually used to compare many different allocators between each
other.~\cite{mimalloc-bench} We slightly modified mimalloc-bench to include our patched
scudo version, and ran the benchmarks between the latest scudo version and our patched
version.

While in the worst case (many secondary allocations with many secondary chunks being
allocated at the same time) the performance impact is quite high, in usual usage it should
not matter match. This seems to also be confirmed by the benchmark tests of mimalloc-bench
we ran, results of which are shown in \autoref{tab:MimallocBench}.

\chapter{Conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this project, we used our previous work and acquired knowledge on the scudo allocator
and the gef plugin we built for it, to try to find some exploits that work on the scudo
allocator, similar to the glibc exploitation houses. The source code of the different
exploitation scripts, the used exploitable programs, as well as some utilities to
facilitate exploit development are available at
https://github.com/SIELA1915/house-of-scudo.

We found two exploits, which are based on a common technique, which relies on breaking the
cookie used to generate checksums, for which we implemented a python library taking
advantage of the speed of C code to bruteforce the cookie given one header leak. One of
the two exploits was coincidentally fixed by a change in the latest scudo versions, while
for the other exploit no fix was available. We therefore implemented a possible
mitigation, which we benchmarked to test for the performance impact and then submitted to
the official llvm repository in the form of a pull request.
